# Flight Data Lookup and Merge

## Overview
The Flight Data Lookup and Merge project is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for retrieving and consolidating aviation-related data. The system comprises two main functionalities: *lookup* and *merge*. These operations leverage a structured dataset consisting of flight schedules, fleet information, and airport details to deliver insightful results.

## Features
1. Lookup Mode:
   - Flight Number Search: Users can input one or more flight numbers to retrieve detailed information about the specified flights.
   - Data Enrichment: The lookup functionality incorporates data from flight schedules and fleet records, offering a holistic view of the queried flights.

2. Merge Mode:
   - Data Integration: The merge operation combines data from flight schedules, fleet information, and airport details to generate a comprehensive dataset.
   - Result Output: The merged data is exported to a CSV file, providing users with a consolidated view of relevant flight information.
